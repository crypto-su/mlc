## What Is a Microstrip Line?

A microstrip line is a transmission line formed by a conductive strip over a ground plane, separated by a dielectric substrate. It is commonly modeled using the quasi-TEM approximation, where electromagnetic fields propagate partly in the substrate and partly in air. Because of this, the effective dielectric constant (εeff) is one of the most important parameters in the design.
